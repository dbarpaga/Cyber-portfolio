projects for cyber security portfolio
This will be a collection of my projects for potential cyber security related employers. 


Keylogger:

This is a keylogger I wrote in python to capture keystrokes. A keylogger records the keystrokes the victim inputs and relays the information back to the bad actor by either creating a txt file or even emailing the data to the attacker. These can compromise login information, banking information, credentials and more. It is vital to protect against malware such as this by proper IPS and enduser training.
